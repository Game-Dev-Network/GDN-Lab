# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to GDN's Code Gift!

## Project License

We distribute anything in the Code Gift under an adapted CC0 license. To ensure safety for people that use it, we'll get you on your first pull request to sign a Contributor License Agreement. It isn't that long, but it ensures that we can continue using your contributions later on.

## Project structure

We use the following format to structure code snippets in here:

```
code-gift/
|-- Contributions/
|   `-- Unity.md
|   `-- Unreal.md
|   `-- Gamemaker.md
|   `-- Xenko.md
|   `-- Godot.md
|	...
```

Each engine/platform has its own contributions list.

## Adding a new contribution.

1. Create your own GitHub repository for your project.
2. Choose a license (see below) and put it in LICENSE.md in the root directory.
3. Create a README.md with a project description and instructions in the root directory as well.
4. Fork this repository, edit an appropriate contribution file, filling required fields and omitting reviewer field.
5. Commit and create a pull request back into the `master` branch. If this is your first pull request, you'll also need to accept the CLAâ€”you'll get instructions for this once you've created your pull request.
6. Wait for your pull request to be approved.

### Choosing a license

Each snippet has its own license. Make sure to pick the right one because we don't accept changes to the license unless the moderators believe that there is significant reason to change the license.

We only accept permissive licenses. That means it must be able to be used for commercial use without any additional restrictions to non-commercial use, and the person using it must not be forced to adopt a particular license except for changes made to your snippet.

If you don't know which license to choose then we recommend either CC0 or ISC.

The following lists are subject to change at any time.

Examples of permitted licenses:
* CC0
* Certain Creative Commons licenses (e.g. CC BY)
* The Unlicense
* MIT
* BSD
* ISC
* Apache
* Mozilla Public License

Examples of licenses that we won't accept:
* GPL and AGPL (or any other FSF licenses that are similar to these)
* LGPL (because it's likely that larger works won't use interfaces provided by the licensed work)
* Certain Creative Commons licenses (e.g. CC BY-NC-ND, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND)
* Other strong and mild copyleft licenses
