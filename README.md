## FAQ

### What is GDN?

It's game development community over on Discord, a place where everyone from total beginners to industry veterans can talk about cutting edge technology, their favourite Nintendo easter eggs or marketing tips for release.

We've got a bunch of channels to ensure the smooth running of chats, such as:
* #code: Solving bugs, asking all the questions.
* #art: Show off your awesome skills or get some pointers.
* #looking-for-members:  A channel for forming groups, Rev-share/Unpaid projects here.
* #lfm-paid-projects: Devs need to eat too, we separate all paid projects for visibility and require proof of a contract so that our devs are protected in their dealings.
* #legal-support: Curious about IPs? Work contracts? This is the place for you. We have a legal mage scheme to ensure that the answers you receive from them are of a higher quality.
* #unity: We have a high percentage of Unity users as part of our community, if you have a query then I'm sure we've got someone to help!

We love hosting Game Jams with fruity names too! Our past ones have been Apple Jam, Blueberry Jam, Cherry Jam, Dragon(fruit) Jam, Elderberry Jam, and Fig Jam. We also have one called Gooseberry Jam which is currently taking place.

We're invested into making sure your developer experience is as smooth as possible, so whether you join us for a day or a year, we'll do our best to help you become the best developer you can be <3

### Do I need to attribute to the original author?

No you don't _have_ to, but we're sure that the original author would appreciate it if you did!

### How do I contribute?

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md][Contributing Document] file.

### Can I request that a snippet be created?

Yes. Either create an issue or head over to our [Discord server][Discord Server Link].

Be aware that making a request won't necessarily mean that one is created for you.

### Can I join your Discord server

[Yes][Discord Server Link]—we'd love to see you there!

### Why do you use a Contributor License Agreement? Aren't they generally frowned upon?

If we decide to relicense contributions then it makes it difficult if we have to get permission from each contributor. By sublicensing the license that is granted to us by each contributor, we can easily change the sublicense.
