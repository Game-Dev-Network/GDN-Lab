# GDN Code Gift

This is a project to share code snippets and projects for a variety of game engines freely to developers.

## Project Licenses

Always check the individual projects for the latest license conditions. The license on this repo isn't necessarily the same one used on projects we link to.

## FAQ

### Why can't I commit directly to master?

We've protected the master branch—create a new branch and submit a pull request.

### What is GDN?

It's game development community over on Discord, a place where everyone from total beginners to industry veterans can talk about cutting edge technology, their favourite Nintendo easter eggs or marketing tips for release.

We've got a bunch of channels to ensure the smooth running of chats, such as:
* #code: Solving bugs, asking all the questions.
* #art: Show off your awesome skills or get some pointers.
* #looking-for-members:  A channel for forming groups, Rev-share/Unpaid projects here.
* #lfm-paid-projects: Devs need to eat too, we separate all paid projects for visibility and require proof of a contract so that our devs are protected in their dealings.
* #legal-support: Curious about IPs? Work contracts? This is the place for you. We have a legal mage scheme to ensure that the answers you receive from them are of a higher quality.
* #unity: We have a high percentage of Unity users as part of our community, if you have a query then I'm sure we've got someone to help!

We love hosting Game Jams with fruity names too! Our past ones have been Apple Jam, Blueberry Jam, Cherry Jam, Dragon(fruit) Jam, Elderberry Jam, and Fig Jam. We also have one called Gooseberry Jam which is currently taking place.

We're invested into making sure your developer experience is as smooth as possible, so whether you join us for a day or a year, we'll do our best to help you become the best developer you can be <3

### Do I need to attribute to the original author?

It depends on the license applicable to the files that you're using. Check this file on how to determine the license.

### How do I contribute?

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md][Contributing Document] file.

### Can I request that a snippet be created?

Yes. Either create an issue or head over to our [Discord server][Discord Server Link].

Be aware that making a request won't necessarily mean that one is created for you.

### Can I join your Discord server

[Yes][Discord Server Link]—we'd love to see you there!

### Will the license change over time?

We will not accept pull requests that alter the license of existing parts of the code snippet, except where the GDN moderators determine that there is a significant reason to do so.
